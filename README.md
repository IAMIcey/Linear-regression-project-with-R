## Statement of Purpose
Global temperature has undergone a tremendous change as more and more human activities are involved. According to NASA statistics, extreme events, including wildfires, floods, and hurricanes, have become a frightening new normal. Hotter temperatures, air pollution, and violent storms are leading to immediate, life-threatening dangers for people, including difficulty breathing, malnutrition, and a higher risk of infectious diseases. Our group aims to analyze the relationship between temperature anomaly and pollution to lot further mitigate the extreme weather problem.

## Introduction
Jes Fenger (2009) explicitly explained how air pollution could drive a huge temperature change in the last 50 years. Frederica Perera (2022) studied the relationship between fossil-fuel pollution and climate temperature. However, most recent literature only focused on one type of contamination. Our group considers that there will be some interactions among different types of pollution. In this article, our group will consider the collective impact of water pollution, air pollution, and land pollution on climate change.
